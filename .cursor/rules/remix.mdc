# Remix Framework Guidelines

## Core Principles
- Project is built with Remix - always use the latest APIs and patterns
- Avoid deprecated or legacy Remix APIs

## File Structure & Organization
- Use the app directory structure following Remix conventions
- Route files should be placed in `app/routes` following the routing pattern
- Shared components should be in `app/components`
- Utility functions belong in `app/utils`

## Actions & Loaders
- Extract actions into separate files for better maintainability
- Name action files with the pattern `{feature}.server.ts`
- Use typed responses for all loaders and actions
- Implement proper error handling in all actions and loaders

## Forms & Data Handling
- Use Remix Form components for data mutations
- Implement proper client-side validation with server-side validation as backup
- Use optimistic UI updates where appropriate

## Performance
- Properly split code using Remix's built-in code splitting
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use resource routes for API-like functionality
